# Reverse Engineering the TV-lift
This part details the steps performed to reverse engineer enough of the tv-lit to be able to duplicate the commands using a ESP32 board. The tv-lift itself is built into the end of my bed. Hopefully I will only need the control boxses to figure out a solution.

- The tv-lift I am trying to hack is this one: [TV-Lift](https://nedis.no/no-no/product/lyd-og-bilde/ridedyr/tv-bevegelse/550712741/motorisert-tv-stand-37-65-maximum-skjerm-vekt-50-kg-innebygd-skapdesign-heis-rekkevidde-68-158-cm-fjernstyrtkontrolert-abs-stal-sort)
It looks like this kind of tv-lift is fairly generic, and is sold under many different labels.

- Manual for the tv-lift can be found here: (Manual)[https://cdn.nedis.com/datasheets/TVSM5830BK_MAN_COMP_0120_web.PDF]

## Remote Control
The remote is easy to take apart, and is how i dicovered that my RF-bridge was working with a different kind of RF.
