# Solution
After understanding how the connection between remote and control unit works, I should be able to create a soulution using the ESP32.
The idea is to wire the ESP32 in paralell to the pins coming out from the receiver board, and replicate the commands from remote.

## Test setup
Before making any permanent changes to the control unit, I soldered on some test leads, and connected the ESP32 via a breadboard.
